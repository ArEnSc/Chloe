### 4. **Email Rendering**

- Proper handling of attachments categorized by type

### 5. **UI/UX Enhancements**
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design with overflow handling
- Settings dialog for API key management
- Sync status indicator
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K for search)

### 6. **Technical Features**
